The art of focus is the art of accomplishing impossible things by learning to put all your attention on one thing at a time. 

Accomplishing the extraordinary involves:

1. Deciding where and how you can create real value, and putting other things ASIDE.

2. By **not having a backup plan**, you can put all your energy into your primary plan.

3. Figuring out the most effective ways to excute it.

4. Implementing actual strategies to get people to leave you alone (and not mind doing so).

5. Always have clear view of the one most important thing you can do for the day, for the week, for the month, and for the year to push your vision forward.
