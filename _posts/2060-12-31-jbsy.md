Hey there, I'm Jithendra and welcome to my blog. Here, I write my random thoughts and opinions on music bands and albums (mostly metal).

Want to know a bit about me?
- I love metal music (Mostly doom and blackened death metal).
- I hate pop as a whole - i mean the whole culture (music, movies, tvshows, games which are too mainstream) - Why? - because they are mainstream, lol.
- But, I listen to other generes too like hiphop (old-school), jazz and rock!
- I also love watching horror movies and reading horror books.
- If you need any recommendations for metal music/ horror stuff or even if you have any to share - connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy)
