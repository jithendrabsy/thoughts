Hey there, I'm Jithendra and welcome to my blog. Here, I write my random thoughts and opinions on music bands and albums (mostly metal).

Want to know a bit about me?
- I love metal music (Mostly doom and blackened death).
- But, I listen to other generes too like hiphop (old-school), jazz and rock!
- I also love watching horror movies and reading horror books.
- If you need any recommendations for metal music/ horror stuff or even if you have any to share - connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy) 
- Also check out my homepage - [here](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/) , if interested!
- Lastly, I hate pop (the whole pop)! --- meh!


Bands I've been banging my head lately: (this list changes everytime tho!)

- Candlemass (doom/epic-doom)
- Behemoth (blackened death)
- Dying Fetus (death)
- Septicflesh (melo-death)
- Gojira (prog/heavy?)
- Urgehal (black)
- Suzid (DSBM)
- Lamb of god (heavy?)
