Hey there, I'm Jithendra and welcome to my blog. Here, I write my random thoughts and opinions on music bands and albums (mostly metal).

Want to know a bit about me?
- I love metal music (Mostly doom and blackened death metal).
- I hate pop as a whole - i mean thw whole culture (music, movies, tvshows, games which are too mainstream) - Why? - because they are mainstream, lol.
- But, I still listen to few mainstream generes like hiphop (old-school)!
- I also horror movies and read horror books.
- If you'd love to explore metal music/ horror stuff - connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy) 
- Also check out my tech blog - [here](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/blog/) , if interested!
