Black Sabbath is considered the founding band of metal and their self-titled album, released in 1970,
is considered to be the first metal album ever released. This is a really interesting album because the 
influence of genres like acid rock and their psychedelic elements are much more prominent in this album than 
in most modern metal.

It is one of the very few bands that shaped the whole new genre with theor first album itself. In this post, I want tro talk about their most commercially successful album "Paranoid".
Something that I think is overlooked about Black Sabbath is how funky they could be. Not funky in a general way like a funk band would be, but funky in a weird way.
But their debut album was hated by music journals online. Despite being hated Black Sabbath's self titled debut album sold well and the record company were keen to follow up its success.
Thankfully Paranoid was also made, and it's clear as day this is the one that stays down through the ages, for uhhhhh so many reasons.

Four months after the release of that debut album Sabbath were back in the studio working on the follow up. The whole world witnessed shaking to the heavy riffs of Tony Iommi as the 
band laid down what is generally regarded to be their greatest album. The opening track 'War Pigs' is one of their greatest hits. War Pigs has a slower sludgier tempo for the most part with breaks for quieter sung parts.
In fact 'War Pigs' started life as early as 1968 as a track called 'Walpurgis'. 
It had a slightly different subject matter lyrically and was actually rejected by the reord company for being 'too Satanic' !

The title track Paranoid is a fast piece of incredibly catchy 
hard rock that seems to be the spark that eventually lead to the types of Metal bands that would dominate the early 80's. Planet Caravan is a
spacey almost psychedelic song that is actually kind of pretty. 
And of course Iron Man is an orgy of powerful simple Metal riffs that probably more than any just establishes the hard heavy powerful aspect that is Metal. The album dips for me here w/ the next cople of tracks which are good but not as strong as what's come before and "Rat salad" is just a drum solo really.

But the main question among Black Sabbath fans is - which one is superior?

BLACK SABBATH (self-titled) or PARANOID?

To be honest with my personal opinions, it's hard to say which of the Sabbath albums from 1970 is the greatest one. 
If I absolutely had to choose one, some days I'd probably go for the self-titled debut album, because it chooses a particular mood 
and then nails it perfectly. Then again, other days I'd go for Paranoid, simply because it is more varied. 
Both are equally essential to any metal collection, unless you are absolutely opposite to slow playing in your metal playlists.
