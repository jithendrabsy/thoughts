## Sequoia Capital's Investment Playbook

1. Early-stage is different from other forms of investing. As Don would say, it's predicated on investing in markets undergoing significant change: today's solutions are wrong for tomorrow. A good answer to "why now" upends the Warren Buffet quote about reputations of businesses with bad economics surviving intact. 

2. Similarly, the key to evaluating market size in the context of early-stage venture is to focus on the opportunity size tomorrow, not today. "Who cares" is a great lens to predict and distill this: if this new solution were widely known and available who (how many people/customers, what segments, with what buying power) will care (how much will it improve their lives or businesses)?

3. In a compounding environment, gains from the next few years will always dwarf all cumulative gains from years prior. The goal is to invest in companies that are able to become compounders, help them do so, and enjoy the returns as long as possible.

The question Sequoia asks is whether the future for a given market, company or investment looks brighter than today.

4. You can make money even if you get the investment thesis wrong, lose money even if you get the investment thesis right, and you realize your losses many years before your gains. (Alfred has been at Sequoia for over 10 years and only just had his first two IPOs: Airbnb and DoorDash.)

5. To succeed in venture over the long run you need all three of high IQ, high EQ, and hustle. (We would also add high patience to the list!) What you don't need are specific qualifications: Michael Moritz was a journalist, Roelof Botha was an actuary, Don and Doug were sales guys and Alfred was a COO. Greatness can come from anywhere.

6. There will always be too much capital chasing too few good deals. It's true today, it was true when Alfred started 10 years ago, and it was true when Michael Moritz started 20 years before that. But the winning companies will always generate outsized returns by using that capital to their unfair advantage. Your job as a VC is very simple, but devilishly hard: invest in those companies.

## Pace Capital Frameworks v0.1

Venture capital is a unique opportunity that enables the purchase of time with money. It allows a company to reach forward in time and hire people that would otherwise not have joined. The same applies to strategic partnerships and contracts.

Without a sufficient answer to the question of ‚ÄúWhy Now?‚Äù, any venture capital invested into the company or category is subsidizing company building that would be better served by alternative capital instruments (with a lower cost of capital, i.e. debt, etc.).

## New Interaction / Use-cases

While the reaction layer seems more likely to live on in a world where large platforms have a stranglehold on identity, I am more interested in the identity layer and its ability to enable new platforms.

This isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt have both, but my view today is that the more valuable company starts as one that builds a product where a digital representation of ourself (or ourselveS) is customizable, carries brand value, easily manipulated, and creates a sense of an emotional tie between the human and the avatar. This feels most likely to happen if you also control a key platform component at the beginning.

Those creating avatar-first products must push users towards specific interactions or use-cases, and then leave the door open for emergent behaviors.

While admittedly obvious, I believe that product focus that ushers in a new behavior or interaction, paired with an ecosystem that allows for a continually fresh experience and form of expression is what will win.

## Larunch a Dot/Dots/a Circle

There is an underlying assumption that a basket of features = sum(individual features). That is true sometimes, but other times a bunch of features launched together have a compound aggregate value - they're much more valuable launched together than individually.

## Open AI

**Musk's Approach to AI**

Musk played no small part in building a collective mythology. ‚ÄúThe way he presented it to me was ‚ÄòLook, I get it. AGI might be far away, but what if it‚Äôs not?‚Äô‚Äù recalls Pieter Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley who worked there, along with several of his students, in the first two years. ‚Äú‚ÄòWhat if it‚Äôs even just a 1% or 0.1% chance that it‚Äôs happening in the next five to 10 years? Shouldn‚Äôt we think about it very carefully?‚Äô That resonated with me,‚Äù he says.

**Open AI Situation**

Altman‚Äôs message is clear: OpenAI needs to make money in order to do research‚Äînot the other way around.

This is a hard but necessary trade-off, the leadership has said‚Äîone it had to make for lack of wealthy philanthropic donors. By contrast, Seattle-based AI2, a nonprofit that ambitiously advances fundamental AI research, receives its funds from a self-sustaining (at least for the foreseeable future) pool of money left behind by the late Paul Allen, a billionaire best known for cofounding Microsoft.

But the truth is that OpenAI faces this trade-off not only because it‚Äôs not rich, but also because it made the strategic choice to try to reach AGI before anyone else. That pressure forces it to make decisions that seem to land farther and farther away from its original intention. It leans into hype in its rush to attract funding and talent, guards its research in the hopes of keeping the upper hand, and chases a computationally heavy strategy‚Äînot because it‚Äôs seen as the only way to AGI, but because it seems like the fastest.

**What went wrong at Open AI**

 They largely do research based on scaling up known ideas, have at times hyped up their work beyond merit, changed their tune to be for profit which is weird given they want to work in the public interest, and that despite calling themselves OpenAI they publish and open source code much less frequently than most labs -- and with profit incentive they will likely publish and open source even less). The original article also presented the positive side

## Pmarca on Modeling Role Models

I don't know how to do extraordinary things without extraordinary effort. More cultures in tech are tilting against extraordinary effort (so big arbitrage opportunity for extraordinary effort)

@pmarca : I'll make the counterargument to @stevesi's advice to be true to yourself:

Don't be true to yourself. Especially early on, your true self probably isn't good. Identify and study the role models and become like somebody better than yourself.

## New Computing

We have VR devices that are good for games and some narrow industrial use cases and there is a hope that the hardware and software can grow to become universal... AR glasses, on the other hand, are still a frontier science question - can we create optics that look like a normal pair of reading glasses (or, one day in a few decades, contact lenses) and yet that can put something into the world that looks as though it‚Äôs really there, in broad daylight, with a good field of view? And if we can, as for VR, it‚Äôs magical, but how useful is that? Looking at this stuff today is rather like seeing a multitouch demo in 2005 - it‚Äôs clearly good for something, but what? 

However, all of this might be the wrong mental model for thinking about the next step. As well as looking at the sequence ‚Äòmainframe - PC - web - smartphone‚Äô, we should probably also think about what was going on underneath: ‚Äòdatabase - client/server - open source - cloud‚Äô, perhaps...

We‚Äôve spent the last few decades getting to the point that we can now give everyone on earth a cheap, reliable, easy-to-use pocket computer with access to a global information network. But so far, though over 4bn people have one of these things, we‚Äôve only just scratched the surface of what we can do with them. There‚Äôs an old saying that the first fifty years of the car industry were about creating car companies and working out what cars should look like, and the second fifty years were about what happened once everyone had a car - they were about McDonalds and Walmart, suburbs and the remaking of the world around the car, for good and of course bad. The innovation in cars became everything around the car. One could suggest the same today about smartphones - now the innovation comes from everything else that happens around them.

## Competition

A trillion dollar company with tens of thousands of engineers runs lots of projects and experiments, and there are lots of things that theoretically they could do, and that they might explore. But you have to ask not ‚Äòwould it be a problem for me if they got into my industry?‚Äô but rather ‚Äòwould it make any sense for them to get into my industry?‚Äô 

If Google can turn your business into a trivial part of Google, it will try. If it would have to recreate your entire company inside Google, it probably won‚Äôt. 


A few overlapping questions: 

Can this naturally be added to the existing skills, assets and points of leverage that they already have? Might they squash you without noticing?

Can it scale massively with little incremental, marginal cost? 

Can they turn it into that - can they turn it from offline manual processes into low-friction, automated, scalable software? 

Would they have to grow a new limb to make it work - would they have to create an entirely new kind of capability?

How big is it? Larry Page talked about the ‚Äòtoothbrush test‚Äô - will this be as widespread as a toothbrush? Is it worth the oppportunity cost? Is it worth growing a limb?

## 10x Technologies

...changing paradigms can open opportunities for 10x improvements whereas incremental 10% improvements often become increasingly difficult to achieve and have certain limits.

Jeff Bezos: Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent change of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you‚Äôre still going to be wrong nine times out of ten‚Ä¶.The difference between baseball and business, however, is baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it‚Äôs important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

## The convergence of technology and human behavior

Behavior is shaped by the constraints of technology, and in turn, technology is pushed forward by the needs and demands of consumers. When the telegraph was popularized in the 1800s, its rapid rate of transmission made it ideal for urgent and important messages. The invention of the printing press made it much cheaper and faster to create books and manuscripts, spurring a new era of mass media and allowing millions of people to interact with the written word. These inventions created new product categories and consumer demands‚Äîto be faster, to allow for voice, to be portable‚Äîleading to the telephone, the steam-powered printing press, typewriters, in turn causing the next waves of innovation. In the modern era, history repeats itself.

Audio, now squarely at the intersection of consumer behavior and technological change, is at the precipice of a new wave of innovation. Fueled by RSS, followed by the adoption of AirPods, smart speakers, and more, the demand for audio in the form of podcasts and audiobooks is at an all time high. That, in turn, makes entrepreneurs more adventurous in advancing new social and user-generated methods of creating audio content. The next decade of innovation of audio will likely be as productive and valuable that of messaging, video, and other media to date. Audio will create the next generation of startups in social networking, social content platforms, and publishing, and will be embedded into a wide variety of products and services. Follow the innovation‚Äîlisten closely.

## Jim Keller leaving Intel

How could one person be so important at CPU development?
We have no doubt he is one of the best player in the field from the history. But doesn‚Äôt the huge project like CPU development require a lot of good workers rather than one genius?
There are so many engineering tradeoffs when developing a cutting edge chip. Picking the right ones is very hard; if you have a leader who staffs the project and sets the culture and decision making process in such a way that the right tradeoffs are consistently made, then that is golden.

## Facebook‚Äôs missing platform

The implication of Social Networking 2.0, though, is that users want to be in multiple places at the same time in order to express their multiple identities. This, by extension, means that Facebook is probably never going to create places for everyone.

In fact, it appears we are headed in the opposite direction: the promise of Social Networking 2.0 is that in the proliferation of identities we can achieve something better in the digital world than we ever could in the analog one, but Facebook has consigned itself to being one provider amongst many, instead of the foundation on which that proliferation occurs.

## Apple and Tesla

Apple is a 1st mover in innovation, but a 2nd mover in business. It‚Äôs strategy has always been to wait for competitors to test demand and market waters, then once this is validated, to carve in, innovate and use its brand to gain market share and ultimately dominate it. It did it with Fitbit to make the Apple Watch, not surprised it will with Tesla.

‚ÄúSo is a billion dollars cool? He ponders the question carefully. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not cool. I think being a wealthy member of the establishment is the antithesis of cool.
