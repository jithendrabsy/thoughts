## You Are Programmed In A Memetic Machine


> “We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.” ― Cooper - Interstellar

This is the problem I'm thinking about every day.

With the sheer amount of information available on the internet today, our mind is in a constant racing state on the glamorous status on social media. We are becoming cyborgs with the most powerful supercomputer in the human history in our pocket but with the most mediocre minds. 

How did we end up like this?  How come there are billions of more users on Tiktok (garbage) than Goodreads (knowledge)?
