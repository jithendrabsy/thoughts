The product strategy behind Apple Music/ AirPods/Homepod is based on the “Apple Experience”. Apple is moving beyond one device by offering users the ability to create custom Apple experiences involving various form factors and software platforms. Apple services/devices will help to connect everything together.

In other words, **Apple Experience** will likely destroy Spotify.

Before diving into Apple’s audio strategy, let's talk about the basic strategies and business models (Loops) of big tech companies like Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.


## They Loop Different

### Facebook Loop

> Connection > Visual Communication > Connecting More People > More Ad-Clicking Behavior > Money > Loop

Facebook and Google are data companies focused on offering free, data-capturing services to as many users as possible. Their business models are dependent on achieving scale in order to access as much data as possible.

That’s why FB launch Tinder-like platform last month, so they can keep people staying in the “Facebook Loop”.

## Amazon Loop

> Lower Prices > More Customers > More Services/Buy > More Customer Behavior > Money > Lower Tech Cost > Loop

Amazon is a retail platform company focused on getting you to buy more stuff over time. Scale in terms of purchase volume is needed in order for the cash flow/reinvestment cycle to continue.

## Apple Loop

> Device as a hub > App Store Shopping > More Seamless devices > App Store Shopping/ Services > New Device every year > Money

As you can see from [the Steve Jobs email](https://qz.com/196005/the-steve-jobs-email-that-outlined-apples-strategy-a-year-before-his-death/) that outlined Apple’s strategy a year before his death in 2010, Apple is a design company focused on selling tools capable of fostering superior and “seamless” experiences. The scale is considered a byproduct of a properly functioning business model.

## Apple’s Strategy to Beat Spotify and Amazon

Back to audio part, the product strategy behind Apple Music/ AirPods/Homepod is based on the “Apple Experience”.

Apple is moving beyond one device by offering users the ability to create custom Apple experiences involving various form factors and software platforms. Apple services/devices will help to connect everything together.

### Apple Music will likely destroy Spotify

In other words, **Apple Experience** will likely destroy Spotify.

Spotify, with 71 million paying users with Apple Music a distant second with 30 million as of September 2017, touts an even larger number in its filing: 1.6 billion payment-enabled smartphone owners expected by 2021. But In a new report in The Wall Street Journal, it appears that Apple is gaining subscribers at a higher rate in the United States, and will surpass Spotify for the number one spot this summer.(In feb 2018, Apple already has 36 million paying subscribers)

Of course, globally, Spotify remains no.1, but Apple is growing at a higher rate in the US — 5% a month verses Spotify’s 2% per month. The WSJ says that Apple’s growth has been fueled in part by its devices in the hands of consumers, and with the release of its HomePod.

As you can see, Spotify delivers more than 70 percent of its sales to music rights holders, despite efforts to improve profit margins. And Warner Music Group just sold 75 percent of its Spotify shares, for about $400 million last month.
We all know why.

### Spotify has structural problem: Control, Growth

Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, Merlin (the representative for many independent labels), which own 87% of the music on Spotify as measured by streams.It seems highly unlikely Spotify’s Cost of Revenue will improve much in the short-term: those record deals are locked in until at least next year.

It means once the growth of Spotify starts to slow even a just bit, it will be in very serious trouble.
Not long before, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in the filing.:

> “The old model favoured certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label.. They needed access to a recording studio, and they had to be played on terrestrial radio to achieve success. Today, artists can produce and release their own music. Labels, studios, and radio still matter, but in a cluttered landscape, artists’ biggest challenge is navigating this complexity to get heard. We believe Spotify empowers them to break through.”

The latest news is it has another plan to reduce its reliance on its main suppliers: Spotify said it has no interest in signing artists, or paying for artists to record before, but they do now.
OK, Spotify seems to get close to Netflix this time. But actually they’re nowhere near Netflix when it comes to producing — or even loosely controlling — their own content, which Apple doesn't care at all. Apple wants to sell more devices, not Apple Music. And they have way more leverage to grow and keep users in their loop and create another rev.

## Dots will beat dot

![device](/public/media/device.jpg)

`iPhone As A Hub` -> `Device As A Dot`

It is this greater dependency on one device that opens the door for new, more personal products to flourish (Connecting the dots”).

Apple never saw the HomePod as anything more than an accessory of an ecosystem, like the AirPods earphones. HomePod isn’t just the Siri Speaker or another smart audio player. Products in this category already exist.
Apple is making Sonos more affordable and keeping their customers in the product circle, while Amazon is making a bet that there is a new platform to be built/won in the form of voice and they’re going to push hard into it with a bunch of low-cost appliances.

Apple isn’t selling a high-quality music speaker. Instead, Apple is selling a new kind of seamless music experience — one that isn’t able to be produced with mobile devices, low-end speakers used for digital voice assistants, or even high-end speaker systems that may exceed $1,000. This music experience consists of a music streaming service, a digital voice assistant, and a combination of hardware and software that allows HomePod to map its surroundings and adjust sound output accordingly.

We see a similar dynamic take place with AirPods. Millions of people aren’t buying AirPods because of their superior sound quality. Instead, AirPods just work seamlessly with Apple devices and offer a way greater user experience.

## The Dot of the dots (Homepod) vs. A dot (Echo)

![amazon-dot](/public/media/amazon-dot.jpg)

Echo is a truly standalone product at the center of an ecosystem. The cloud-based operating system has made it easy for developers to create thousands of skills or voice-activated apps. By contrast, the HomePod is essentially an extension of the iPhone, like another dot of the dots. When someone asks the HomePod to open a third-party app, the request won’t go directly to the cloud, as with Echo, but to an iPhone.
Apple could still eventually add features to the HomePod. These might include its own app ecosystem and support for competing for music services.

> This is one of the reason why I will heavily bet on Apple over Amazon in audio world: Standalone vs. Ecosystem.

From another point of view, Alexa is another "smart device" which connecting Amazon's customer ecosystem with its user. But it's a totally different system from Apple:

> It does not have any Network Effect, yet. Because Alexa is designed to be the first device of its future hardware ecosystem.

So, until that happens, Apple will still be king in a category invented by itself.

### Beats

Apple had made a big bet regarding the future of `sound on the go` and headphone wires were the enemy. We now see Apple unveiling its revised strategy for controlling sound in the home. The best way to analyze products like AirPods and HomePod is to look at them as the latest weapons in Apple’s battle for controlling sound in our lives.

Apple kept the Beats brand for headphones speaks to how Beats headphones are likely serving a different target market. In fact, Apple has positioned Beats headphones as a compliment to AirPods. This has likely gone a long way in removing the oxygen from the wireless headphone category market and preventing competitors from establishing any kind of beachhead.

## The Last One to Close the Door

First, we should realize the audio market (including podcast, voice controlled assistant…) is way bigger than the sound market (music). So even Spotify and Apple are leading the market, it is possible the next voice interface with intelligence will trigger the shift of current user behavior.

- Audio: Podcast, , Earpods, Homepod, Amazon Dot, Alexa, Siri...
- Sound: Spotify, Apple Music

For now, I think Apple understands the market better than Amazon. It also has better advantage because of the huge hardware user base. So Apple is playing the safe card. On the contrary, Amazon believes that non-phone voice assistants are a big and growing market and betting on it heavily. However, for now, Alexa is used primarily as a voice-controlled speaker, not an assistant.

In the long term, I still think Amazon has the chance to marsh it in ecosystem of hardware. But they need to develop/acquire the next Android in the voice economy. Otherwise, Apple still has the edge.
Somehow, it reminds me of Microsoft and Xbox. Microsoft saw the Xbox as a strategic way to get a computer into the living room. But in the end, Xbox is still just used for gaming.

Xbox is fairly sophisticated as a TV computer, but using the controller is a horrible experience to me. AppleTV, with all its flaws, is a far superior experience for me as far as a TV add-on.

The winner is the one did the right design.
