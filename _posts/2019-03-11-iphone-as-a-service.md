**Apple is putting iTunes on Samsung TVs (2019.1)**

**Apple Music service and the AirPlay 2 protocol are available on multiple non-Apple platforms. (2019)**

I think this is the biggest strategic move on business side since the iPhone was unveiled in 2007.

## New Partners

Beyond component manufacturers, Apple’s newer partners -- Hollywood studios, movie stars, newspapers and magazine publishers -- are more wary of working with tech giants, or have already teamed up with rivals like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

Apple push to transform itself into a leading digital services provider. The company may even discuss a monthly video games subscription. 

## New Competition

Unlike the iPhone in 2007, which broke new ground, Apple’s video service faces stiff competition from well-established players. Netflix, Amazon, Walt Disney Co., Hulu, and AT&T Inc. are investing at least $20 billion combined each year on content, while Apple is spending about $1 billion this year


## New Service Maybe?

Here are things I think Apple should do:

By offering iPhone up to a 4 years terms and bundled with AppleCare+ Thief and Loss and iCloud Backup. With Optional Apple Music, Apple News Magazine, Apple TV and Apple Game. All paid via an Apple Branded Credit Card within Apple Pay backed by Goldman Sachs.

You could have the iPhone Services starting at ~$35/Month even for an iPhone XS Max. If you add up all the other "Services" pack. That is roughly $75/month for the Full Apple Experience.

~$40 to even $100 a month is affordable to a lot of people. And my guess this could be part of the reason why Apple has been pushing the prices of iPhone.

There is another advantage to Apple, this strategy requires huge cash flow and can not be easily copied by its competitor. Apple would be effectively trading its immediate return of cash from selling product for long term customer lock in.

They could even bundle in a MacBook, iPad, and watch at a higher price tier so that the hard core Apple fans could pay a single monthly subscription fee and always have the latest model of every device.


## Apple Need New "Dots" 

If they continue their strategy of differentiation through privacy. Doing "services" for people intrinsically means knowing about them. What they watch, what they read, what they listen to, what they need, who they are. The more you know, the better you can "service" them. 

Another clear indication that they're serious about this transition to services will be making them available on third-party devices. Android has ~55% market share in the US, and >80% globally. Roku has 35% of the smart TV market (through both their dedicated devices and TV integrations), Apple has ~15%.

A video streaming service that's only available on iOS and Apple TV will be inevitably niche, and no real competition for Netflix. This also means they will likely have to pay a premium for content (and a much larger amount per user) as creators will prefer to be on platforms where more people will see their work.

But ultimately, supporting Android and 3rd party streaming devices goes against Apple's DNA. Apple still sees itself as a hardware company, and software and services exist to give people reasons to buy their hardware.
