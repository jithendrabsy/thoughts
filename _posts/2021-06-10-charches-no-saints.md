description: Very satisfying mix of death and thrash!

There is something magical and bloody nasty about the sweet 
spot where death and thrash metal meet. DESASTER have been keeping that delicious mix 
since the late '80s and the great thing is they are keeping their true German tradition.

The band's latest studio record "Churches Without Saints" is a typical masterpiece thrown 
into the world of theological darkness, accompanied by a aesthetic feel which is raw and black, 
but still smoother and less crackling than most of the other death/thrash bands. 
The most important attraction of this album is atmosphere that created a haunted environment with a prelude in 
the opening track "The Grace Of Sin", playing off a minimalist piano line along with a somber mix of string and wind instruments.

Then the album quickly rushes into other mind-blowing tracks like "Learn To Love the Void" and "Exile is Imminent" where the classic riffing 
can be observed along with some great haunting melodies here and there. I personally felt some tracks along the record are direct 
inspirations from other bands like Sodom-inspired thrashing violence of "Hellputa" and 
the Destruction-like impact factor of "Armed Architects Of Annihilation".

These holy-moly guys went from death/thrash to much catchier black/thrash fusiuon in theor second half. The second half of the record is more 
convincing than the first one. "Endless Awakening" is more of a pure black metal character that fairly had some more melodic and Swedish/Norwegian sound. 
In my opinion, this is the illest track on the album and desaster completely killed it. This is the longest song on the album and fuck I got goosebumps all over 
my fucking body while listening to this track. The post-punk pulse of the closing outro track "Aus Asche" 
hints at a deeper well of hope that darkside of heavy metal is still alive and it's never gonna fucking die.

So Conclusion?
The album is absolutely good with some killer tracks but like many other modernish albums - the tracks are easily forgettable. 
I donâ€™t come back to this again most probably, except for the "Endless Awakening" which is fucking heavy and soo true to the genre. 
Churches Without Saints simply is another high energy of metallic overkill from the most nasty bastards out there mixing thrash and death.
