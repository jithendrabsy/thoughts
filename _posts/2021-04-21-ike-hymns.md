I KILLED EVERYONE is a five-member deathcore band that has released thus far three albums based on themes of fantasy, death and struggles. 
Their first two albums didn't received the praise they ahould get but their recent 2019 album "Lamenating Hymns" serves as a comeback release for them.
This album comprises of nine crushing tracks with full of deathcore madness and runs over 33 minutes.

To be honest, I don't really have a whole lot to say about this one. The overall sound of Lamenting Hymns is similar to many of the 
other deathcore and downtempo albums I've listened recently. 
But it is certainly something that I enjoyed being a fan of heavy music. As it is one of 2019’s first old-school-deathcore-revival records—and probably one of the best in my opinion.
It is nostalgic but at the same time I felt the album to be very monotonous. The first listen was satisfactory but I felt it boring on my second listen.

I enjoyed the unique decent production mixed with the dark atmosphere. The instruments and lyricalness are almost flawless across the whole album. Atlease, I felt so.
There is nothing so special about the guitar riffs, they seemed familiar. But the breakdowns are freaking good as hell especially on the track "A Nameless Mist".
This is my favorite track on the album as it is very different gruelling outro and slammy dark vibes. Some other tracks I liked are "The House of Exile" and "Dread".

At the end of the day, Deathcore is not really my shit. This album didn't blowed me away but it is decent and good at what it does. 
I don't come back to this again most probably, two times is more than enough. The riffs, vocals, and everything else in between are what one would expect out of a 
deathcore album except the breakdowns which are very different atleast from the deathcore albums that I listened. I feel this blows away the people who are more into deathcore.
