## Naval on Truth-seeking Systems

Evolution works by mutation and selection.

Innovation works by trial and error.

Science works by conjecture and criticism.

Free markets work by entrepreneurship and risk.

All truth-seeking systems work roughly the same way.

## Sean Parker on Grit and Being Cool


You have got to be willing to be poor [as an entrepreneur],” he says. “There was a time when I was living out of a single suitcase. I had a rule that I wouldn’t stay on one person’s couch for more than two weeks because I didn’t want to become a bother.”

“So is a billion dollars cool? He ponders the question carefully. “No, it’s not,” he says. “It’s not cool. I think being a wealthy member of the establishment is the antithesis of cool. Being a countercultural revolutionary is cool. So to the extent that you’ve made a billion dollars, you’ve probably become uncool.” “


## Sean Parker on Google (2011)

“What comes after the revolution is inevitably bureaucracy,” he says. “Whoever wins the revolution builds a bureaucracy.” And what will end up happening is the big powers will control the tech industry.
