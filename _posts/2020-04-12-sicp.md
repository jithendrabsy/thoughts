### Install MIT Scheme on Mac

[32-bit system](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mit-scheme/stable.pkg/9.2/mit-scheme-9.2-i386.dmg)

[64-bit system](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mit-scheme/stable.pkg/9.2/mit-scheme-9.2-x86-64.dmg)

Click and drag the MIT/GNU Scheme.app into the Applications folder and it will be installed in your system. Then open shell:

For 64-bit package:

```shell 

sudo ln -s /Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64

```

Then simply run:

```shell

scheme

```


### Advice: Don't write abstractions first

Write the program like you would naturally, then when you recognize the patterns (i.e. Monad, Applicative, ...), rewrite it using the abstractions. Use higher order functions to separate similar functionality, and before you know it you have a nice combinator library which describes your problem domain well.
