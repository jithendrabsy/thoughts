KREATOR is a modern thrash band out there that gets so much love for their hard work over the decades. They are also hated in the metal community.
But, haters gonna hate! Think of the massive levels of criticism that Metallica gets. Metallica is the band which is known as one of the "BIG 4" but still gets criticism.
People judge bands by all sorts of means. Anyways, I'm not going to judge them either. Opinions are personal. Aren't they? okay, let's jump into the review of KREATOR's single - "Satan is Real".

Coming out with a single that’s simply named “Satan Is Real” sounds boring right? I thought the same when I came across this one! A matured band like KREATOR naming theor single as 
Satan is Real is too childish and awkward for me. But, Let me be honest - this is miles away from being the most original and mind-bending song when it comes down to its level of creativity and originality.

"Satan is Real" is different from most Kreator songs. They are known for their fast thrash songs but this song is slower and still a thrash. From the beginning to the end it stays this speed. 
The style of this songs is also very different compared to their other works. It is more standard heavy metal as it is slower.

This song is not anything anti- to religion or god (as most people think it is, lol!). 
The lyrics compares bad people in the world to Satan. The song describes what the bad people do. The chorus of the song emphasizes that evil is on earth. 
Mille's vocals are as usual powerful and in this song he is like narrator. The riffs are not so thrashy but they are melodic. But it isn't boring.

To be honest, I still have to listen the whole album - "Gods of Violence". This track "Satan is Real" gave me a feel that the whole album is sure to pack freaking hell in it. 
I will post my review of the album very soon! Also, this tracked proved that KREATOR can handle doing multiple styles in theor music.
