Most business people tend to focus on the downside protection, which is maintaining, competing rather than creating. Before you explore your business idea or strategy , it’s important to figure out the odds of creating your own game, not just follow the trend (a game invented by other players). 

## The Nature of the Game: Changing

> “Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.” — Jason Zweig.

This is one of the reasons why companies rise and fall. Because they learned to play one game and got good at it. But the market constantly changes to a new kind of game.

Disruption is the art of calculated risk-taking. Before you start to think something new, as I mentioned, it’s extremely important to explore the odds of creating your own game to dominate the market.

So, where is the business opportunity for a startup founder? What’s the right strategy to leverage the odds of creating the game? Why Sean Parker once said,” Facebook should not have won, MySpace Blew It”?

## The Window of the Game: Maintaining

> Experts are usually wrong on large deviations from norm. They do ok on incremental projections. Also skeptics never do the impossible or discover anything radically new because they like the safety of company. Large innovation needs large risk. - Vinod Khosla

The current business models are less durable than they used to be while the software is eating the world.

The opportunity exists in the business world because when companies become successful is when collective leadership becomes most focused on maintaining success. Usually, leadership tends to see more risk in the downside of the current plan and than the upside in taking on new things. They are un-incentivized to react to new products and distribution channels.

Things those companies doing regularly:

-View a temporary trend as a competitive advantage

-Focus on building reputational momentum

-Believe it’s easy to span across generations

-Love being right

-Love the new idea, not the new way of thinking

-Reward  “data-driven”

Being right and staying right is different. Doing well reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your proven business model.

What makes disruption so devastating is the fact that absent a crisis, it is almost impossible to avoid. Managers are paid to leverage their advantages, not destroy them; to increase margins, not obliterate them.

## The Odds of the New Game: Creating

### Beyond the Average

> “In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can’t do what all the other startups do. I don’t think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.

> The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you’re running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company — that is, to grow about ten percent a year.

> The same thing will happen if you’re running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you’ll go out of business.”- Paul Graham

Counterintuitively, truly transformative companies rarely fit into pre-defined boxes. Limiting focus to “yesterday’s” best-performing industries couldn’t see the new opportunities. As I said, those business leaders who are running the show are very bad at telling you what you shouldn’t do and what should do, even they are/were successful.

The traditional business thinking process is like:

-Dissect the dominant business model in your industry.

-How big is the remaining market?

-Find a way to get in.

Instead, to maximize the odds of creating your own game, you should just totally ignore “the trend...the data…the user”. Numbers are about the past if you wanna create new things, you need to focus on what’s the one that can’t be copied and people don’t know they need it yet. If you thinking about the market size, the market you are thinking about to get in is full of competitors.

So you should think about:

-What’s the unique leverage other companies can’t/hard to clone? How to create that moat?

-What’s the opportunity cost of building that moat?

-What’s your compound leverage?

### Category Creation = Game Creation

Don’t follow the Lean Startup way of creating new things, those are the methodology for the mediocre thinkers. Which market depends on you, not on the user. You’re not in the market the users think you’re in — you’re in the market you believe you’re in. 

Steve Jobs did not do customer discovery. Google didn't even know who its customers were for years. The most successful companies don't discover markets, they create them. I believe in creating, not discovering will lead to the future.

Most failed companies made the wrong “awesome product” by choosing the wrong market and following the wrong direction "told by the user you talked to". Most users get pitched "understandable idea" because founders think they have to prove market fit before building product depth. If your business fits in a market design by someone else, you are “default dead” in a competition. 

Don’t ask users, ask yourself: Do I have a vision of the future and design a market that only you can build and dominate?
