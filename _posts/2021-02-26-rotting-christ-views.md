Bathory and Manowar are band staples for epic metal, Metallica and Megadeth are for Thrash. 
But for heavy music at its most rousing, the standard-bearers are "Rotting Christ".

Despite gaining fame in the spirit of black metal, they are still very much underground even today in their 3-decade history.
Their albums are rich in melody and atmosphere, 
and I still remember when I first had a listen to Rotting christ - the feel of the bandâ€™s spinetingling presence before vocalist(sakis) even begins to sing.

Do you know when a band is called as a good band?

If you listen to the band, and you understand and identify the band so easily. Rotting christ is one of very few metal bands like this. I still can't 
recognise Epica, ManOWar by listening to their songs but I can always recognize if spotify daily curated list played Rotting Christ's song.


Wanna listen to their discography, and wondering where to begin?

Lemme rank their albums:) (Note: RI only listened to 6 albums and ranking them according to my personal taste!)

1. Theogonia: _Enuma Elish_, _Nemecic_
2. Non Serviam: _Ice shaped god_, _Where mortals have no pride_
3. A dead poem: _Full Colour is the Night_, _A dead poem_
4. Aealo: _Demonon Vrosis_, _Pir threontai_
5. Rituals: _Ze Nigmar_
6. Khronos: _If it ends tomorrow_, _Art of sin_, _Time stands still_

I don't understand all the hate against them after their recent album - 
"The Heretics". Is it really too bad? Or all thehaters are just people who hunt for the next big thing in metal genre? If you are of such kind, you won't 
find much interst/ traction in real and classic metal. Go listen to Justin Beiber and Ariana Grande - LOL!

Rotting Christ absolutely deserve their place in the glory of black metal!
