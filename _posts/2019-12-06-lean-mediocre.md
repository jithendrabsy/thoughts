All the successful outliners in the startup creation path were looked ridiculous at the beginning. Facebook was a social network for the college student, Snapchat was for high school people. Elon Musk was even failing to demo SpaceX's mini rocket launch at his backyard for 3 times. Today, what they have built have changed how we think about the future. 

I believe in creating the future with a strong vision, not finding it. 

## Don't Believe In Luck On The Ridiculous Path

> "When you chase success, you try to win at the same game as everyone else. You chase the current big winners by acting as the current big winners. In the effort to look or act like someone else, to be closer to their path, you forget that startup success lies at the end of paths not yet taken. When you chase success you fear failure and forget to do ridiculous things." -[Phin Barnes](https://sneakerheadvc.com/walk-the-ridiculous-path-34b80bbff572)

You can't 'find' the future, you 'bend' the future. Nowadays, we just attribute too much to luck, which stops us from actually thinking and doing amazing things. We should all be looking for far more predictable paths to success and having the ridiculous deep conviction on an idea we truly loved.

 The experiments on finding luck are are traditionally coupled with short-termism, gauging our success in an incredibly tight timeline and thinking in a narrow spectrum. This mindset stop founder to chooose the more unclear and ambitious path. You either want to choose an easy path to "feel safe(Lean)" or choose an unclear path to forge, rather than test the market you want to build(Vision). Vision could be a materiel image if the founders have enough imagination and conviction at the first place. 

Even you eventually build a successful company, there might be an upside you did not "upside".
 

## Lean Startup(finding) vs. Fat Startup(forging)

> There are a bunch of teams that have thoughtfully done hypothesis testing, pivoted when the metrics suggested it wasn’t working, and ultimately run out of money. I often wonder whether conviction on a given direction would have saved them. It’s not that the lean startup / MVP approach can’t work. There are plenty of success stories there. And it’s not like startups like Color didn’t raise a ton of money and ultimately completely fail.[Source](https://twitter.com/sachinrekhi/status/1158507212739960833)

The Lean Startup way is for the mediocre mindset, the fat startup way is for visionaries, period. The other way to put it, the Lean way determines your mindset as a founder and destroys your potential product/business upside upfront. 

Because, the "launch fast, fail fast way(launch an MVP and iterate it)" is to optimize for the company and investor, not the consumer. On the contrary, the MDP way is to optimize for user experience, which is the most important part of building a successful company. Having the MVP-mindset is that the founders don't put themselves enough time and effort to "think hard enough" on their initial idea before collecting short-term metrics for feeling safe. 

Instead, the visionaries create the macro (10x) jump and then ask customers for the micro improvements. Kieth Rabois at Founders Fund once emphasized building a successful product and company is like producing a movie. You have a script and vision of the plot, cast the characters first. Then film the movie. Then you sell tickets.

Tell me a legendary movie director who will ask the audience first.


# Invented, not discovered

Here are some examples:


### Instagram

[Instagram delighted 1 billion users….but almost didn’t. The founder did talk to the users but did NOT listen to them.](https://overcast.fm/+Vl3ssPn0E/04:13)

### Snap

From [Listen to your customers but not too much](https://www.chowyonghan.com/listen-to-your-customers-but-not-too-much/) 

"We created stories in response to what our community was asking for. They wanted a send-to-all button. People were sending snaps to their friends, I wish I could hit send-to-all, the snaps would go to all my friends, and they could see what I'm up to. We realized that if we created a send-to-all button, people would spam their friends all day long and they'd end up hating Snapchat. We decided to create a way for people to share content with all their friends, but without spamming them."

Here's Spiegel's secret: listen to customers, but not too much. Don't take their responses at face value. Customers can't understand the second-order implications of their suggestions, so their tips shouldn't automatically serve as your product roadmap. Read between the lines and identify the deeper challenges that their responses are hinting at.

In the case of Snapchat, people didn't want a send-to-all button. They wanted a way to communicate with all their friends at once. Spiegel used that information to invent a new social media format that every customer wanted, but no customer had asked for.

### Pinterest

From [Pinterest CEO](http://allthingsd.com/20120313/pinterest-ceo-ben-silbermanns-lesson-for-start-ups-go-your-own-way/)

“The hard part about that idea of ‘minimum viable product,’ for me, is you don’t know what ‘minimum’ is, and you don’t know what ‘viable’ is.” In the early days, Pinterest had “catastrophically small numbers,” Silbermann said. Nine months after launch, the site counted 10,000 users, with few of them active on a daily basis. Silbermann said he recently picked up Eric Ries’s “The Lean Startup,” and was grateful he didn’t read it at the time, because it might have convinced him to give up at that point." 


### Superhuman

From [FirtRound Review, CEO of Superhuman](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)

"But no matter how intense the pressure, I wasn’t ready to launch. Common practice would be to "throw it out there and see what sticks,” which may be fine after a few months of effort when the sunk cost is low. But the “launch and see what happens” method seemed irresponsible and reckless to me — especially given the years that that we had invested."
