## New Computing

We have VR devices that are good for games and some narrow industrial use cases and there is a hope that the hardware and software can grow to become universal... AR glasses, on the other hand, are still a frontier science question - can we create optics that look like a normal pair of reading glasses (or, one day in a few decades, contact lenses) and yet that can put something into the world that looks as though it’s really there, in broad daylight, with a good field of view? And if we can, as for VR, it’s magical, but how useful is that? Looking at this stuff today is rather like seeing a multitouch demo in 2005 - it’s clearly good for something, but what? 

However, all of this might be the wrong mental model for thinking about the next step. As well as looking at the sequence ‘mainframe - PC - web - smartphone’, we should probably also think about what was going on underneath: ‘database - client/server - open source - cloud’, perhaps...

We’ve spent the last few decades getting to the point that we can now give everyone on earth a cheap, reliable, easy-to-use pocket computer with access to a global information network. But so far, though over 4bn people have one of these things, we’ve only just scratched the surface of what we can do with them. There’s an old saying that the first fifty years of the car industry were about creating car companies and working out what cars should look like, and the second fifty years were about what happened once everyone had a car - they were about McDonalds and Walmart, suburbs and the remaking of the world around the car, for good and of course bad. The innovation in cars became everything around the car. One could suggest the same today about smartphones - now the innovation comes from everything else that happens around them.

## Competition

A trillion dollar company with tens of thousands of engineers runs lots of projects and experiments, and there are lots of things that theoretically they could do, and that they might explore. But you have to ask not ‘would it be a problem for me if they got into my industry?’ but rather ‘would it make any sense for them to get into my industry?’ 

If Google can turn your business into a trivial part of Google, it will try. If it would have to recreate your entire company inside Google, it probably won’t. 


A few overlapping questions: 

Can this naturally be added to the existing skills, assets and points of leverage that they already have? Might they squash you without noticing?

Can it scale massively with little incremental, marginal cost? 

Can they turn it into that - can they turn it from offline manual processes into low-friction, automated, scalable software? 

Would they have to grow a new limb to make it work - would they have to create an entirely new kind of capability?

How big is it? Larry Page talked about the ‘toothbrush test’ - will this be as widespread as a toothbrush? Is it worth the oppportunity cost? Is it worth growing a limb?

## 10x Technologies

...changing paradigms can open opportunities for 10x improvements whereas incremental 10% improvements often become increasingly difficult to achieve and have certain limits.

Jeff Bezos: Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent change of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten….The difference between baseball and business, however, is baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

## Pre-defined boxes

Truly transformative companies rarely fit into pre-defined boxes. Limiting focus to “yesterday’s” best-performing industries will miss these companies.

## The convergence of technology and human behavior

Behavior is shaped by the constraints of technology, and in turn, technology is pushed forward by the needs and demands of consumers. When the telegraph was popularized in the 1800s, its rapid rate of transmission made it ideal for urgent and important messages. The invention of the printing press made it much cheaper and faster to create books and manuscripts, spurring a new era of mass media and allowing millions of people to interact with the written word. These inventions created new product categories and consumer demands—to be faster, to allow for voice, to be portable—leading to the telephone, the steam-powered printing press, typewriters, in turn causing the next waves of innovation. In the modern era, history repeats itself.

Audio, now squarely at the intersection of consumer behavior and technological change, is at the precipice of a new wave of innovation. Fueled by RSS, followed by the adoption of AirPods, smart speakers, and more, the demand for audio in the form of podcasts and audiobooks is at an all time high. That, in turn, makes entrepreneurs more adventurous in advancing new social and user-generated methods of creating audio content. The next decade of innovation of audio will likely be as productive and valuable that of messaging, video, and other media to date. Audio will create the next generation of startups in social networking, social content platforms, and publishing, and will be embedded into a wide variety of products and services. Follow the innovation—listen closely.

## Scientist vs Engineer

Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a “rocket scientist”, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon.

## Jim Keller leaving Intel

How could one person be so important at CPU development?
We have no doubt he is one of the best player in the field from the history. But doesn’t the huge project like CPU development require a lot of good workers rather than one genius?
There are so many engineering tradeoffs when developing a cutting edge chip. Picking the right ones is very hard; if you have a leader who staffs the project and sets the culture and decision making process in such a way that the right tradeoffs are consistently made, then that is golden.

## Facebook’s missing platform

The implication of Social Networking 2.0, though, is that users want to be in multiple places at the same time in order to express their multiple identities. This, by extension, means that Facebook is probably never going to create places for everyone.

In fact, it appears we are headed in the opposite direction: the promise of Social Networking 2.0 is that in the proliferation of identities we can achieve something better in the digital world than we ever could in the analog one, but Facebook has consigned itself to being one provider amongst many, instead of the foundation on which that proliferation occurs.

## Apple and Tesla

Apple is a 1st mover in innovation, but a 2nd mover in business. It’s strategy has always been to wait for competitors to test demand and market waters, then once this is validated, to carve in, innovate and use its brand to gain market share and ultimately dominate it. It did it with Fitbit to make the Apple Watch, not surprised it will with Tesla.


## Indi vs. System

One of the biggest reasons why things go sideways is that people optimize individual pieces of a system without paying attention to how those changes will impact the system as a whole.

## Naval on truth-seeking systems

Evolution works by mutation and selection.

Innovation works by trial and error.

Science works by conjecture and criticism.

Free markets work by entrepreneurship and risk.

All truth-seeking systems work roughly the same way.

## Sean Parker on grit and being cool


You have got to be willing to be poor [as an entrepreneur],” he says. “There was a time when I was living out of a single suitcase. I had a rule that I wouldn’t stay on one person’s couch for more than two weeks because I didn’t want to become a bother.”

“So is a billion dollars cool? He ponders the question carefully. “No, it’s not,” he says. “It’s not cool. I think being a wealthy member of the establishment is the antithesis of cool. Being a countercultural revolutionary is cool. So to the extent that you’ve made a billion dollars, you’ve probably become uncool.” “


## Sean Parker on Google (2011)

“What comes after the revolution is inevitably bureaucracy,” he says. “Whoever wins the revolution builds a bureaucracy.” And what will end up happening is the big powers will control the tech industry. He paints a picture of “Google pretending to be Switzerland, but doing back deals with everyone, and Apple being left alone to build the Deathstar.” Guess where that will leave most startups.
