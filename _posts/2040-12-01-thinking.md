## Scientist vs Engineer

Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a “rocket scientist”, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon.

## Jim Keller leaving Intel

How could one person be so important at CPU development?
We have no doubt he is one of the best player in the field from the history. But doesn’t the huge project like CPU development require a lot of good workers rather than one genius?
There are so many engineering tradeoffs when developing a cutting edge chip. Picking the right ones is very hard; if you have a leader who staffs the project and sets the culture and decision making process in such a way that the right tradeoffs are consistently made, then that is golden.

## Facebook’s missing platform

The implication of Social Networking 2.0, though, is that users want to be in multiple places at the same time in order to express their multiple identities. This, by extension, means that Facebook is probably never going to create places for everyone.

In fact, it appears we are headed in the opposite direction: the promise of Social Networking 2.0 is that in the proliferation of identities we can achieve something better in the digital world than we ever could in the analog one, but Facebook has consigned itself to being one provider amongst many, instead of the foundation on which that proliferation occurs.

## Apple and Tesla

Apple is a 1st mover in innovation, but a 2nd mover in business. It’s strategy has always been to wait for competitors to test demand and market waters, then once this is validated, to carve in, innovate and use its brand to gain market share and ultimately dominate it. It did it with Fitbit to make the Apple Watch, not surprised it will with Tesla.


## Indi vs. System

One of the biggest reasons why things go sideways is that people optimize individual pieces of a system without paying attention to how those changes will impact the system as a whole.

## Naval on truth-seeking systems

Evolution works by mutation and selection.

Innovation works by trial and error.

Science works by conjecture and criticism.

Free markets work by entrepreneurship and risk.

All truth-seeking systems work roughly the same way.

## Sean Parker on grit and being cool


You have got to be willing to be poor [as an entrepreneur],” he says. “There was a time when I was living out of a single suitcase. I had a rule that I wouldn’t stay on one person’s couch for more than two weeks because I didn’t want to become a bother.”

“So is a billion dollars cool? He ponders the question carefully. “No, it’s not,” he says. “It’s not cool. I think being a wealthy member of the establishment is the antithesis of cool. Being a countercultural revolutionary is cool. So to the extent that you’ve made a billion dollars, you’ve probably become uncool.” “


## Sean Parker on Google (2011)

“What comes after the revolution is inevitably bureaucracy,” he says. “Whoever wins the revolution builds a bureaucracy.” And what will end up happening is the big powers will control the tech industry. He paints a picture of “Google pretending to be Switzerland, but doing back deals with everyone, and Apple being left alone to build the Deathstar.” Guess where that will leave most startups.
