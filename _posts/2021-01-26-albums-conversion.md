I was a rap fan for a while, and I have listened to some metal samples on hip-hop songs. The best example can be — Slayer’s “Angel of Death” sample on Public Enemy’s “She Watch Channel Zero?!”. Rap and Metal are almost similar, they share many things in common — from headbanging beats to ‘PARENTAL ADVISORY’ stickers on their album covers. But it is during this lockdown, I got more into metal. In this post, I am going to share (recommend) 9 metal albums that turned me into a metalhead.

## 1. “Vol 3. The Subliminal Verses” by Slipknot
This was the very first metal album that I listened to and it sounded pretty average for me. The lyrics are lousy and they wear those stupid masks — my first impression of this band and the album is that they’ve got an image that automatically appeals to people who like bands for how edgy they look and act rather than their music. I can’t really say anything too negative on the subject matter of this album because I was completely new to metal at that time but to be honest, I couldn’t find one track that I enjoyed even slightly.

This album made up my mind to conclude that metal is not a genre that I should spend my time upon. But — I was wrong!

## 2. “Toxicity” by System of a Down
System of a Down is the most experimental metal band. The experimental nature of these four Armenian guys hasn’t always paid off. The metal community hates this band and their music so much, and I can see why they are hated. But for someone like me who is a rap fan, this album is like a treasure in the genre. There are some core metalheads who think that Toxicity is one of the very best metal albums of all time. System of a Down was not just another horrible Nu-Metal band. They had something else, something more. Again to be very honest, this is their only best album (IMO).


## 3. “Ride the Lightning” by Metallica
Metallica is considered as one of the Big-4 metal bands along with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. This album is a damn impressive thrash metal album that rightfully deserves to be called a “classic”. The album starts off with “Fight Fire With Fire” which is a gentle acoustic guitar ballad, nothing out of the ordinary until that chaotic riff comes in and like an explosion rips the calm serenity into panic and discord.


## 4. “Vulgar Display of Power” by Pantera
I find it interesting when I see metalheads on Reddit hating this album and some even call this — “Most overrated album by the most overrated band”. But I think Pantera managed to distill down the powerful essence of metal. This album is best to feel motivated or powerful (lol!). Song for song, Vulgar Display of Power is a pummeling example of rock ‘n roll, well-deserving of its praise. I personally feel Pantera as AC/DC of metal. They are hated, but still, their albums are outstanding, the same as AC/DC in rock.


## 5. “Reign in Blood” by Slayer
Slayer is another greatest Thrash metal band and one of the Big-4 metal bands. This is a hallmark album in metal and one of the cornerstone thrash releases, coming out alongside “Master of Puppets” by Metallica and “Peace Sells” by Megadeth. I still can’t believe this album, It is very intense, and brutal. The album is generally shorter than any other metal album but still, it was like 35 mins of spending time with the devil. This album has everything a metal album needs — speed, aggression, and riffs.


## 6. “Rust In Peace” by Megadeth
Holy thrash! This album is really something. It was my first Megadeth album, and it totally got me hooked. The guitars are crazy good on this album. This album made Megadeth my favorite metal band (next to Black Sabbath tho!). a masterpiece with no obvious flaws, no fillers, and some of the most obscenely thrilling moments in all of recorded metal history. Holy Wars… The Punishment Due, Tornado Of Souls, and Hangar 18 may be the obvious highlights, but the entire record is a banger.


## 7. “Paranoid” by Black Sabbath
Black Sabbath is considered the very first metal band. They started and shaped the whole metal genre. ‘Paranoid’ may be the ultimate heavy metal album. Three of its songs — the title track “Paranoid”, “War Pigs” and “Iron Man” — are the genre staples. Every song of this album shaped a new metal sub-genre. Speed metal of Paranoid, trippy space blues track Planet Caravan, doom metal of Iron man, and many. They also have a sense of humor on the closing track. This album again is a masterpiece.


## 8. “The Art of Partying” by Municipal Waste
This is ain’t a classic band or ain’t even a famous one. But, if catchy thrash needs a definition, that may easily be Municipal waste. The riffs and thrash breaks are strongly influenced by classic bands like Slayer and Exodus. This album brain numbingly dumb lyrics and repetitive guitar riffs, but bands like this are so refreshing, as they do not take themselves too seriously, and it’s just pure fun!

## 9. “Ashes of the Wake” by Lamb of God
This album is brutal, skillful, and awesome. My bones and brain got crushed while listening to this album, lol. I liked their own style of metal and overall songwriting. The guitars and drums are just mind-blowing. The perfect balance among the drums, bass, guitars, and vocal is outstanding — not too noisy or heavy, but clean and powerful.

These are the albums that introduced me to metal. In my next posts, I will review all these albums and many more posts are about to come.

Until then: Stay safe, keep calm, and listen to f**kin’ Metal! 😈
